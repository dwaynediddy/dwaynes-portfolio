                <p class="blog-post-text">This is where I stumbled upon coding, while I was playing Rugby in Poland during the summer. I met a guy at a bar who was English and/or Australian and/or Polish who is now a good friend and mentor of mine.
                    I was always on my computer and I was already inadvertently programming via YouTube guides. I was trying to build things with Python like keyloggers and figuring out how to Rat someone’s computer for reasons I’d rather not discuss and definitely had nothing to do with losing all my stuff on RuneScape and wanting to hack other players to get it back.</p>

                    Coming into the year 2020 I pronounced it the year of the hustler. Was time to grind time to code and try to get a real job!
                    Unfortunately the first week I didn't follow my own credo, I went to the gym only twice, My laptop didn’t leave my car after I got home the whole week. Weekend came along, Code? hour or two might do the trick. It didn’t.</p>
